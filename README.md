iOS-SFCollectionViewWithCards
=============================

App showing a collectionView with dynamically sized cells


This application demonstrates how to use UICollectionView with variable cell sizes. It shows how to build different sized
cells in Interface Builder, and control when they are displayed programatically.

For this application, there is only 1 viewController (SFDefault) and that view is populated with data objects called "DMCardItem".


Good luck!
